Lesson 3 Reflections File
-------------------------

Reflect: using a remote repository

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
=> When you want to collaborate more easily with peer developers or share the files and content with non-tech savy users

Reflect: Manual vs Automatic Pull

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
=> There might be pulls that would address earlier development so one would like manually control what to pull and when

Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
=> Fork is a github copy of a repo within github. Clone is a local copy of a repo from another location locally or remotely, example would be from
github to a local directory. A branch is a local linear repo copy to be worked on changes which would later be merged to master.

Reflect: Local copies of remote branches

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
=> you can modify it offline and travel. Later when online, one can push in and merge changes to the remote repo.
